For each of the part, I have created separate source file namely 'DecissionTree_Part1' and 'DecissionTree_Part2'. 
I have wrote all the source file in python programming language.

Each of my source code reading from 'Excel'file for further purpose.
    Example:
	
	pd.read_excel("C:\\Users\\Sourav Biswas\\Desktop\\trainDataPart2.xlsx", "Sheet1") \\please change the path
	
For reading, writing in to a Excel file, I have setted path of my Desktop. So, for running all these source code one must need to change
the path of his/her desktop. 

I have import below packages in my source code:
    numpy, pandas, xlwt, xlrd, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn

One must install all these packages before running all my source code.

In the submission file, I have added train and test data file for each of the part along with source code. For part 2, we need to form the
data in desirable format. So, I have added also data formatin code for part 2 named as 'DataFormingtraining' and 'DataFormingTest'. Both the
data formation code reading from the given raw data and formating the data in desirable format.


NOTE: If 'DecissionTree_Part1.py' showed some error after running please run it for 4-5 times. Sometime it showing some error sometime not.
